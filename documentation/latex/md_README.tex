Just open a terminal (C\+T\+R\+L+\+A\+L\+T+T) go to the folder containing the source code and the example image and type the following command\+:

gcc {\ttfamily pkg-\/config -\/-\/cflags gtk+-\/3.0} -\/o timed\+\_\+practice \mbox{\hyperlink{timed__practice_8c}{timed\+\_\+practice.\+c}} {\ttfamily pkg-\/config -\/-\/libs gtk+-\/3.0}

In order for this command to work, make sure you have G\+TK installed added to the P\+A\+TH, this is easier when made right at the installation with sudo apt-\/get install libgtk-\/3-\/dev

after that make sure to run the installation with ./timed\+\_\+practice

after that just enjoy the program and tweak with it as you please!

Happy learning
